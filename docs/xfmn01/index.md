## Overview

XFMN-01 is an experimental synthesizer module combining Cross-FM (frequency modulation) and noise generation. Create unique sonic textures through multi-oscillator cross-modulation, chaotic noise generation, and non-linear distortion processing that goes beyond traditional FM synthesis.

## Key Features

- **Dual FM Oscillators**: Two independently controllable FM voices with cross-modulation
- **Chaotic Noise**: Organic noise generation using stochastic algorithms
- **3-Mode Distortion**: Overdrive, Distortion, and Harsh distortion modes
- **High-Quality Filtering**: Multi-mode Biquad filter (LP/HP/BP/Notch)
- **Comprehensive CV Control**: Full CV control with parameter smoothing
- **Real-time Analysis**: Built-in spectrum analysis and dynamics detection

Perfect for experimental sound design, industrial music, ambient textures, and any musical context requiring unique, evolving sonic landscapes.
