# Grainer

Real-time granular synthesis plugin for VCV Rack.

## Overview

Grainer is a real-time granular synthesis processor with advanced randomization that transforms live audio through controllable grain manipulation. Control pitch, size, position, and density while introducing organic variations that reveal unexpected textures and sounds.

With support for up to 64 simultaneous grains (32 by default) and a 5-second recording buffer, Grainer balances precise control with creative unpredictability for live performance and sound design.

This VCV Rack module is based on the original Max for Live grainer plugin: [https://tsugumasa320.gumroad.com/l/grainer](https://tsugumasa320.gumroad.com/l/grainer)
