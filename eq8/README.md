8-band stereo parametric equalizer optimized for music production in VCV Rack.

## Overview

EQ8 provides professional-grade equalization with eight carefully selected frequency bands designed for musical applications. Each band offers precise ±12dB gain control with high-quality biquad filtering.

## Key Features

- **8 Fixed Frequency Bands**: Musically optimized frequency selection
- **Stereo Processing**: Independent left/right channel processing
- **High-Quality Filters**: Biquad peaking filters with Q=1.0
- **Real-time Processing**: Zero-latency audio processing
- **Professional Grade**: Optimized for music production workflows

## Quick Start

1. **Connect Audio**: Patch stereo source to LEFT/RIGHT inputs
2. **Adjust Bands**: Move sliders to boost/cut desired frequencies
3. **Monitor Output**: Connect LEFT/RIGHT outputs to your mixer
4. **Fine-tune**: Use musical reference while adjusting

## Frequency Bands

### Low Frequencies
- **60 Hz**: Sub-bass control, fundamental low-end
- **170 Hz**: Bass warmth and punch
- **310 Hz**: Low-mid clarity and definition

### Mid Frequencies
- **600 Hz**: Mid-range presence and vocal clarity
- **1 kHz**: Critical midrange, vocal intelligibility
- **3 kHz**: Upper midrange, vocal presence

### High Frequencies
- **6 kHz**: High-frequency detail and clarity
- **12 kHz**: Air and sparkle, harmonic content

## Control Details

### Gain Control
